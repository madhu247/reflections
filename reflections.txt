How might using version control make you more confident to make changes that could break something?

Ans : I can use git checkout to go to the previous versions if something breaks in my current version

Now that you have your workspace set up, what do you want to try using Git for?

Ans : I have a prject and I want to use Git as a version control for that project






git clone ==> download to our local directory

git diff ==> shows difference between two commits

git log ==> show all the commits we did

git commit ==> save the file and create an ID for that version

git checkout ==> Our repository go to the previous version

git init ==> converts your directory to a git repository

git status ==> can see the changes in the last commit
