When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work
local?

    When more than one people are woking on my project then I would create a repository and
    and share my repository details to other so we can both work on same project on 2 diff 
    computers at the same time 

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git
automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

    If GitHub Automatically pulls, at the time of Pulling I mught be working on some files so
    There would be a conflict

How would you collaborate without using Git or GitHub?  What would be easier,
and what would be harder?

    I use comments on the program files. that you unnesssarily increase the size of my program
    and tracking would be problem that if some has an intention olf adding a bug to the code

When would you want to make changes in a separate branch rather than directly in
master?  What benefits does each approach have?

    There might be errors in the new idea so that master will not get disturbed.


git remote ==> to create a remote connection from my local repository to github

git remote add origin(name of the remote connection in the local) 
origin is optional name

git push origin master ==> command to push our local repository to GiHub

git pull origin master ==> command to pull the commits from GitHub to local repository

I can fork a repository of other into my GitHub just by Clicking fork.
if two people are working on the fork we can add colloboraters in github

if there are errors in the pull request then if we push again then it will automatically raise a pull request
